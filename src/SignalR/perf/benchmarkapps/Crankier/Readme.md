Options:
  --target-url <TARGET_URL>                   The URL to run the test against.
  --workers <WORKER_COUNT>                    The number of workers to use.
  --connections <CONNECTION_COUNT>            The number of connections per worker to use.

Notes:

* `TARGET_URL` needs to be the route to your hub exposed by `UseSignalr` in your application.
* `CONNECTION_COUNT` defaults to 10,000.

#### Examples

Attempt to make 10,000 connections to the `echo` hub using WebSockets and 10 workers:

```
dotnet run local --target-url https://localhost:5001/echo --workers 10
```

Attempt to make 5,000 connections to the `echo` hub using Long Polling

```
dotnet run local --target-url https://localhost:5001/echo --connections 1000 --transport LongPolling
```
